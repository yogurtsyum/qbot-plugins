# qbot 8ball plugin
This plugin will add a magic 8 ball command.

## Instructions
* Make a file named `8ball.js` inside of the `commands` folder.
* Copy and paste code from `8ball.js` found on this repository into your editor/host.

## If you want to chnage the answers read this.
* To change/add answers go to `8ball.js` then go to where it says `let replies = ` and in the [] you can change the answers.
* Template of adding them `["text here", "text here2", "text here"]` and etc.

* I am guessing you know this but where it says text here that is where you put your answers.
