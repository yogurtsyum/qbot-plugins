# Information
This plugin is a simple command that will send a embed.
If the bot isn't working, then it won't send the embed. Simple.
# Installation
1. Create a file in your commands folder. Name it "test.js". (without the quotation marks)
2. Copy the code that is in the test.js file in this folder. (select all the code, then do ctrl+c)
3. Paste the code into the file you just created.
4. Restart the bot.
5. Use the command, and it should work.
# Conclusion
I don't really know why I made this, I just made it in my freetime. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
